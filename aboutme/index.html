    <p>Let me tell you about myself...</p>
    <p>Along with my family of 7, I live in Mesa, Arizona. One of my favorite things to do is create stuff. Whether it's drawing, painting, playing on my trombone or the piano, crocheting, sewing, composing music, or writing a story, I love creating things and learning something new.</p> 
    <p>Currently, I'm persuing a degree for Computer Science. When I was little, I had a couple opportunities to learn and experiment with some basic code and I instantly fell in love. Through my degree I hope to find a career where I can continue creating and learning new things while being able to support a family.</p>
