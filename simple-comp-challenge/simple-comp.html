            These are fancy waffles that were very yummy. Would you like a waffles too? 
            First, gather the ingredients. Second, grab a mixing bowl, whisk, and pancake gridle.
            Third, measure the ingredients and put them in the bowl. Mix it up!
            Fourth, turn up the temperature on the pancake gridle. Wait a few minutes until it is warm. 
            Fifth, pour small amounts of pancake batter onto the gridle in sections. If the batter is too thin, add flour. 
            If the batter is too thick, add water. 
            Sixth, once the pancakes have golden on one side, flip them to the other side until they're golden brown. 
            Seventh, when both sides are golden brown, place the pancakes off to the side to cool. Enjoy!
