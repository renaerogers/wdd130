        <h4>How creativity has allowed me to express myself and how you can find a safe space too.</h4>

                Sometimes, the world can be stressful and overwhelming. 
                Some people have a specific place they go to find some peace and comfort amongst the chaos like a bedroom or bathroom. 
                Some people have a specific hobby they turn to like baking or gardening or a task like washing the dishes. 
                Creativity has helped me to find many places I can turn to for peace.

                Whether it is reading a book, painting a picture, doodling on my phone or sketchbook, writing a story about one of my characters, playing a musical instrument or even crocheting a new friend, I always have something that I can do to release extra stress or tension. 
                By experimenting and trying new things, I have been able to find a lot of things that interest and help me express myself. 
                I was fortunate to find many of my creative outlets early in life, but not everyone is so lucky.

                For some people, they struggle to find something they can do to express themselves. 
                While I was busy in my own world drawing and creating, I knew several people around me who struggled to find something that they could express their creativity in. 
                Someone who was really close to me did not discover their creative outlet until she was older.

                When she was little, she tried to draw, but was not good at it, and did not find much joy in it either. 
                She tried to sculpt, but that was not it either. Later in elementary school, she found a love for music by joining the band. 
                However, that was not completely satisfying either. It was not until much later she discovered a joy for baking and gardening. 
                Daily, she cares for her succulents and loves baking sourdough bread.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sometimes it is hard and may take a while, but trying new things and stepping out of your comfort zone can help you find something you enjoy that allows you to express your own creativity.
