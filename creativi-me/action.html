                    While I may be more artistically inclined than most people, being creative has also allowed me to think differently in other situations as well.

                    Pursuing creativity and trying to understand the world has helped me picture things visually in my mind. 
                    For example, if you fold a piece of paper several times and use a hole puncher to punch through several layers at once, I can predict where the holes will be once the piece of paper is unfolded.

                    Being able to think creatively has also helped me to think critically. 
                    In mathematics, I can pick up patterns and learn things much faster than most people. In problem solving, I can plan things out to find various solutions for things. 
                    I may not be very good at chess because I do not know the rules very well, but I can hold my own pretty well against an average player. 
                    This is not because I practice or because I get lucky, but because I am able to see multiple scenarios that could happen and how I could get around them. 
                </p>

                    Creativity can be applied to many different aspects of life. 
                    Everyone thinks differently and everyone understands things differently. 
                    If you do not know where your creative potential is, find it!

                    Try new things. Find what interests you and why it interests you. You might learn something new about yourself.
