      <p>
        Throughout my life, I have been considered a very creative person. When I was little, I loved to draw and make things out of Play Dough. When I got older, I continued to draw and even started experimenting with digital art. I also loved to sculpt things out of clay. 
        Branching away from just physical arts, I found a love for reading and writing. I came up with many characters and stories for each one of them, hoping to one day write a book. Alongside reading and writing, I also discovered a deep passion for music. 
        Music has always been a big part of my life. From wandering around my backyard singing a tune I had come up with to playing piano and trombone, I have always loved to listen, play, and create music. Allowing my creativity to shine, I have composed pieces and arrangements for me and my siblings to perform in church. 
        Through every moment of my life, I am constantly trying to create something and let my creativity show. However, none of this would have been possible without the support of my parents. Without their constant support from buying me new crayons and paper to supporting my more recent crochet hobby, they have always been there to help me shine.

      <h3>Creativity in Action</h3>
      <p>
        While I may be more artistically inclined than most people, being creative has also allowed me to think differently in other situations as well. 
        Pursuing creativity and trying to understand the world has helped me picture things visually in my mind. For example, if you fold a piece of paper several times and use a hole puncher to punch through several layers at once, I can predict where the holes will be once the piece of paper is unfolded. 
        Being able to think creatively has also helped me to think critically. In mathematics, I can pick up patterns and learn things much faster than most people. In problem solving, I can plan things out to find various solutions for things. I may not be very good at chess because I do not know the rules very well, but I can hold my own pretty well against an average player. This is not because I practice or because I get lucky, but because I am able to see multiple scenarios that could happen and how I could get around them. 
        Creativity can be applied to many different aspects of life. Everyone thinks differently and understands things differently. If you do not know where your creative potential is, find it! Try new things. Find what interests you and why it interests you. You might learn something new about yourself.

      <h3>Creativity is Freedom</h3>
      <p>
        Sometimes, the world can be stressful and overwhelming. Some people have a specific place they go to find some peace and comfort amongst the chaos like a bedroom or bathroom. Some people have a specific hobby they turn to like baking or gardening or a task like washing the dishes. Creativity has helped me to find many places I can turn to for peace. 
	      Whether it is reading a book, painting a picture, doodling on my phone or sketchbook, writing a story about one of my characters, playing a musical instrument or even crocheting a new friend, I always have something that I can do to release extra stress or tension. By experimenting and trying new things, I have been able to find a lot of things that interest and help me express myself. I was fortunate to find many of my creative outlets early in life, but not everyone is so lucky. 
	      For some people, they struggle to find something they can do to express themselves. While I was busy in my own world drawing and creating, I knew several people around me who struggled to find something that they could express their creativity in. Someone who was really close to me did not discover their creative outlet until she was older. 
	      When she was little, she tried to draw, but was not good at it, and did not find much joy in it either. She tried to sculpt, but that was not it either. Later in elementary school, she found a love for music by joining the band. However, that was not completely satisfying either. It was not until much later she discovered a joy for baking and gardening. Daily, she cares for her succulents and loves baking sourdough bread. 
	      Sometimes it is hard and may take a while, but trying new things and stepping out of your comfort zone can help you find something you enjoy that allows you to express your own creativity.
